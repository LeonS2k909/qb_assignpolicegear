# qb_assignpolicegear

This is qb-core script that assigns police clothing on job update, so as soon as they become police<br>
They also get handcuffs, radio, armor, firstaidkit, binoculars, stungun, appistol, nightstick and a flashlight.

The script aims to ensure that police actually have the correct equipment and don't have to run around the entire police building trying to locate the armory. It doesn't take away from the armory idea because you will still want to set up functionality to resupply there, it just means that cops are ready straight away.

Not tested with qbox but it could work as scripts are mostly backwards compatible.
